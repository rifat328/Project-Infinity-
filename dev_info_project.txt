                        * Project Infinity *
Project Title: Develop a course management application using Python

This project is a class work which will use basic python 3.10 ++
and relative file system to make a course storing system .

                         * Reqirements *
1. Each course should have the information like course code, title of the course, course credit, and
   list of prerequisites (course code) of the course.

2. Adding functionality: To add a new course.

3. Updating functionality: To update an existing course.

4. Deleting functionality: To delete an existing course.

5. All course display functionality: To display information about all the courses.

6. Individual course display functionality: To display all the information of a course.

7. Search functionality: To search for a particular course and display the contents. If the course is
   not present in the application already, then prompt user to add the new course.

8. Prerequisite/main course checking functionality: When you add the prerequisites of a new
   course, make sure the prerequisite course is already exists in the course list. That’s why you
   should have a checking functionality when you are going for adding a new course or adding
   prerequisite of any course. If course is not exists, then prompt user to add the course first to add
   it as a prerequisite of a course, or as a main course.

9. Store functionality: Finally, it should have a store functionality to store all the courses in the
   application into a text file if user wants to maintain a physical copy in his/her hard drive.

10. As this application would be a console-based, so first display a menu containing all the available options
    of the application, and then user will decide what he wants to do. User can exit from the application
    when he pressed “quit”.
